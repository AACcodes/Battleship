 /* so here's what I did...
 
 I created 3 ships for the first of the 10 games.
 I can finish that later I just forgot the nunmber of ships and their respective lengths.
 Everything spot on the board is false. 
 The positions where the ships are located are true.
 
 you can uncomment line 57 in the file Board2.java to see the positions of the ships 
 when you do however, make sure you comment out line 58, which is the final output of the board 

What needs to be done:
   1. create row and column numbers on our board 
   2. create ten games similar to the one already created 
      - this should probablly be done in another file (each different game is in its own file)
   3. create a random generator that chooses which of the ten games you play 
   
If we have time:
   1. have a quit option 
   2. write out the direction to play the game (fairly easy --> using print statments)
   3. have a play again option. 
   
   
I can finish the first game sinareo (I spelled that wrong but idk how to fix it) I started 
and create 4 more tomorrow, if you want to do five as well


happy coding and text me with updates/question!! ;)

Know I'm working on your brownies as a treat for all your hard work

yours truley, (I might have spelled that wrong as well oops....)

Ananya :)
