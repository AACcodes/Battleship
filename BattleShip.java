 /* so here's what I did...
 
 I pretty much finished the game.... it fully works now
 
 IMPORTANT: sorry but i didn't use your Board2 class... all important stuff is in the BattleshipBoard class so please take a look at that
 
 all we need to do now is
 -Make it fancier
 -decide how the 10 computer boards will look (programming is as simple as selecting the diagram)
 -Test!!!!!
 
 Looking forward to those brownies,
-Ayush C
